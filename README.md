# Random Walk Closeness Centrality

Random walk closeness centrality is a measure of centrality in a network, which describes the average speed with which randomly walking processes reach a node from other nodes of the network. It is similar to the closeness centrality except that the farness is measured by the expected length of a random walk rather than by the shortest path.

The concept was first proposed by Noh and Rieger (2004).
